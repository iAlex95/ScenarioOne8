Our project also incorporates user sign-in, which is relatively easy to implement with Django due to the fact that it supports authentication via a module (django.contrib.auth). This will allow users to manipulate only the to-do lists which they create (and restrict access from other users).  As Django implements an admin UI, it is possible to create users via this interface and allows said administrator to manipulate any further aspects such as groups/permissions. This is extremely useful for system maintenance but it is also important to implement users creating their account themselves on the web application.
